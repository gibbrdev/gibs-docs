# Changelog

All notable changes to the Gibs API.

---

## [0.5.8] - 2026-03-19

### Improved
- **Cross-regulation accuracy** — queries mentioning multiple regulations (e.g., DORA + GDPR) now retrieve from all relevant corpora in parallel. Significantly better answers for cross-cutting compliance questions
- **Abstention precision** — improved scope detection for national implementation details, uncovered regulations, and vendor-specific compliance assessments

---

## [0.5.7] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **GitHub Action** — classify AI systems and check compliance directly in CI/CD. Blocks deploys on prohibited/high-risk classification. Two modes: `classify` (risk assessment) and `check` (compliance Q&A). Available at [github.com/gibbrdev/gibs-action](https://github.com/gibbrdev/gibs-action)
- **Usage visibility** — admin endpoint for monitoring API usage across organizations, aggregated by endpoint and regulation

### Improved
- **Webhook reliability** — idempotent event processing prevents duplicate handling
- **Data retention** — automatic log cleanup enforced on startup

---

## [0.5.6] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **MCP tool expansion** — 3 new tools for AI agent integration: `list_regulations` (discover available regulations and topics), `get_article` (fetch raw article text by regulation and number), `check_regulation_scope` (determine which regulations apply to your company). Total: 6 MCP tools
- **Article lookup endpoint** — `GET /v1/articles/{regulation}/{article_number}` returns full article text directly from the corpus. No RAG pipeline, single-digit ms latency. Accepts flexible input formats ("5", "Article 5", "Art. 5")

### Improved
- **MCP tool descriptions** — rewritten for better AI agent discovery. Each tool includes example inputs, detailed parameter docs, and usage hints

---

## [0.5.5] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Monthly usage quotas** — each plan now enforces a monthly request limit (Free: 25, Developer: 500, Team: 5,000, Platform: 50,000). Returns 429 with `X-Quota-Limit` and `X-Quota-Used` headers when exceeded. Counter resets automatically each calendar month.

### Improved
- **Accuracy** — 93%+ on AI Act, 96%+ on DORA, 96%+ on GDPR, 97%+ on cross-regulation queries (200 evaluation questions). Improved abstention precision for out-of-scope questions (non-EU law, unrelated regulations).

### Security
- Removed unused configuration field that implied encryption-at-rest capability

---

## [0.5.4] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- **DORA query routing** — resolved collection routing issue that caused DORA regulation queries to fail
- **GDPR corpus sync** — production corpus updated to match full 644-chunk index (all 99 articles + 173 recitals)

### Verified
- All 3 regulations (AI Act, DORA, GDPR) confirmed operational with end-to-end query validation

---

## [0.5.3] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Structured JSON response mode** — `POST /v1/check` now accepts `response_format: "structured"` to return machine-readable fields: summary, legal basis, requirements, timeline, and cited articles
- **Confidence score** — `POST /v1/check` now returns a numeric `confidence_score` (0-1) alongside the text confidence level, computed from retrieval quality, citation density, and hedging signals
- **Public OpenAPI 3.1 spec** — full API schema at `api.gibs.dev/openapi.json` with typed request/response models for SDK and tool integration

### Improved
- **Faithfulness verification** — verification now checks against all retrieved sources instead of a truncated subset
- **Completeness checking** — single-aspect questions now run the full completeness pipeline instead of being skipped

---

## [0.5.2] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Knowledge graph** — cross-reference retrieval powered by a graph database with 2,550 nodes and 3,879 typed edges across all three regulations
- **AI agent discoverability** — `llms.txt` and AI-friendly `robots.txt` at gibs.dev for LLM and agent crawlers
- **MCP server authentication** — connections now require API key authorization

### Improved
- **GDPR corpus expanded** — full coverage of all 99 articles + 173 recitals (644 chunks, up from 276)
- **Retrieval precision** — graph-enhanced pipeline with multi-level enrichment and reranking reduces noise in single-regulation queries
- **Accuracy** — 96% on AI Act, 98% on GDPR, 95% on cross-regulation, 93% on DORA (200 expert-curated questions)

### Corpus
- AI Act: 836 chunks | GDPR: 644 chunks | DORA: 641 chunks
- Total: 2,121 indexed legal chunks across 3 regulations

---
